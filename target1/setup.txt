--- TARGET 1 SETUP PHASE ---

We used the virtual machine provided on Mike Tie's thumb drive. After it was set up, we made sure its FTP server was configured to run on boot.

We changed the password of the slab account to youllneverguess using the command 'sudo passwd slab'.

We set the following options to true in the vsftpd.conf (FTP configuration) file: Allow anonymous uploads, allow anonymous login, allow uploads, and set user of uploaded files to be root.

We made an uploads directory on the FTP server (full filepath is /srv/ftp/uploads) and wrote a script as root in /srv/ftp that would use bash to execute every file stored in the uploads directory.

As root, we scheduled a cron job to execute the bash script described above every five minutes. We redirected the output of the cron job to a file in /srv/ftp titled results.log, though this was just to improve troubleshooting.

We also put a text file in /srv/ftp with the username and password for slab (slab/youllneverguess) to enable ssh login after ftp file transfer.
