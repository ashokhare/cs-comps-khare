--- TARGET 1 ATTACK PHASE ---

We attacked manicmeese's virtual machine.

Our first step was to find the machine's IP address using nmap to scan for active machines on our network.

Once we found the IP address, we port-scanned it directly with nmap and found that the ssh and http ports (22 and 80) were open.

Since Apache was running on port 80, we decided to check the website first. We examined the source code but were unable to find anything through there.

We then ran gobuster to find hidden files, and found two secret text files, but neither contained much useful information to go off of.

We also tried using curl to execute a directory traversal attack, but initially could not navigate anywhere besides a folder that stored the images.

Eventually, we ran into a hidden directory called .ssh, which contained an RSA key which would enable us to log in via ssh.

We used ssh with the -i flag to log in using the contents of the RSA key file. We were then able to log into the slab account and get a shell.
